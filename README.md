### Non-exhaustive [typescript-to-lua](https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua) types for [Roblox](https://roblox.com).
# Why would you use [typescript-to-lua](https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua) over [roblox-ts](https://github.com/roblox-ts/roblox-ts)?
Roblox-ts has too much runtime for some environments, and always expects a stable instance structure.
When you can't have that, this is a better option. It has no runtime, it can be bundled into 1 file, and you can choose to not import types, if you want to.
Also, As far as I've tested, all typescript-to-lua compatible code can also be transpiled to javascript.
